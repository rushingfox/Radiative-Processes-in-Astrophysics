# Radiative-Processes-in-Astrophysics

This is my personal Log for PHYS5720 Guided Study during CUHK(The Chinese University of Hong Kong)'s 2022 FALL semester, whose topic is Astrophysics-Radiative Transfer.

The book we used is Radiative Processes in Astrophysics, written by George B. Rybicki & Alan P. Lightman. Part of this Log is the problems I have met and my explanations for them, so I think it is very suitable for this book's beginning learners to check when meeting some troubles.

There are no reports or logs required by CUHK for Guided Study students, so I just wrote it for my personal record. Comments or discussions are welcomed!

Thanks a lot to Dr. Leung Po Kin to be my Guided Study supervisor this semester. I have gained a lot from him not only the knowledge but also experience in personal life!

PS: the radiative transfer code part is actually the content for the 2nd semester(2023 Spring Semester), during which I would do some simulation on Radiative Transfer to complete a MSc Dissertation. So I have not wrote too much for it. Maybe I would post something more after completing the MSc Dissertation.
